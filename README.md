# CTO: Clinical Trial Ontology

- This is a collaborative effort undertaken by Fraunhofer SCAI group(Stepan Gebel, Alpha Tom Kodamullil, Sumit Madan, Johannes Darms), University of Michigan(Yongqun "Oliver" He), NIH PubChem (Qingliang "Leon" Li), and NIH/NHGRI (Asiyah Lin) to develop an ontology to represent clinical trials using a small set of core terms. 

- The CTO-core uses Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) as its top level ontology.

- [OPMI](https://github.com/OPMI/opmi) led by University of Michigan and other OBO foundry ontologies serve as the pool of existing terms to import into CTO core.

- The small set of terms were primarily based on the [WHO/ICMJE â€“ ClinicalTrials.gov Cross Reference](https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/trainTrainer/WHO-ICMJE-ClinTrialsgov-Cross-Ref.pdf) selected from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/) and [WHO clinical trial terms](https://www.who.int/ictrp/network/trds/en/)
